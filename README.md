# ModernBERT 

In January 2025, I gave a presentation on ModernBERT at the AI Journal Club in PMI.
I reviewed the technical details including how it was pre-trained, its importance in the industry, and I contrasted it with its ancestor, BERT.

In this repo, I finetuned ModernBERT-base on the NewsGroups dataset, which contains news articles classified into one of 20 classes.

The goal of the experiments was to familiarize myself more with ModernBERT and the finetuning procedure for it, and compare its performance to BERT-base.

This is still a work in progress and I will make some updates to the repo soon.
